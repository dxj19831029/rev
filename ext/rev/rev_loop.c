  /*  Well, what better place to explain how this all works than
   *  where the most wonky and convoluted stuff is going on!
   *
   *  Our call path up to here looks a little something like:
   *
   *  -> release GVL -> event syscall -> libev callback
   *  (GVL = Global VM Lock)             ^^^ You are here
   *
   *  We released the GVL in the Rev_Loop_run_once() function
   *  so other Ruby threads can run while we make a blocking 
   *  system call (one of epoll, kqueue, port, poll, or select,
   *  depending on the platform).
   *
   *  More specifically, this is a libev callback abstraction
   *  called from a real libev callback in every watcher,
   *  hence this function not being static.  The real libev
   *  callbacks are event-specific and handled in a watcher.
   *
   *  For syscalls like epoll and kqueue, the kernel tells libev
   *  a pointer (to a structure with a pointer) to the watcher 
   *  object.  No data structure lookups are required at all
   *  (beyond structs), it's smooth O(1) sailing the entire way.  
   *  Then libev calls out to the watcher's callback, which
   *  calls this function.
   *
   *  Now, you may be curious: if the watcher already knew what
   *  event fired, why the hell is it telling the loop?  Why
   *  doesn't it just rb_funcall() the appropriate callback?
   *
   *  Well, the problem is the Global VM Lock isn't held right
   *  now, so we can't rb_funcall() anything.  In order to get
   *  it back we have to:
   *
   *  stash event and return -> acquire GVL -> dispatch to Ruby
   *
   *  Which is kinda ugly and confusing, but still gives us 
   *  an O(1) event loop whose heart is in the kernel itself. w00t!
   *
   *  So, stash the event in the loop's data struct.  When we return
   *  the ev_loop() call being made in the Rev_Loop_run_once_blocking()
   *  function below will also return, at which point the GVL is
   *  reacquired and we can call out to Ruby */
